      <h2>Make org.postgresql:postgresql a full module.</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc">
            The Postgres JDBC driver for Java</a
          >
          has an Automatic-Module declaration. This means it has a stable module
          name, but it is still lacking a full module-info. Without a full
          module-info the driver cannot be used with jlink. Considering Postgres
          is both a very popular database and my personal favorite, this stinks.
          Especially since I think there would be
          <a href="https://mccue.dev/pages/5-29-24-module-compilation"
            >non-trivial benefits</a
          >
          if a significant portion of libraries worked fully with the module
          system tooling.

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The gradle build for the postgres library is fickle and from what I
            tried, annoying to configure to do this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Postgres is shading in a few libraries and that feels like it could
            be annoying... somehow
          </li>
          <li>
            Its dependency on checker-qual should also be bumped to the newest
            version.
          </li>
